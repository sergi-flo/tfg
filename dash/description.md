### HOW TO USE WEB APP

**All the data used in this web page is from various patients that have suffered from epilepsy. Nonthelees all the data that is shown in the graphics is anonymous and will not contain any personal information from the patient.**

First of all, choose a patient of which you want to visualize the data. Once you have chosen the patient, the next step is the selection of the graph to display. Here are the 7 graphs available to select:

- **Multiplot:** This graph allows you to visualize the correlation between all the variables you want in a scatter matrix.
- **Scatterplot:** This graph allows you to view the correlation between 2 variables.
- **Histogram:** This graph shows the number of times a value is repeated in a variable.
- **Heatmap:** This graphic shows the magnitude of a variable as a color in 2 dimensions.
- **3D Scatter:** This graphic allows you to visualize the correlation between 3 variables in a 3D space.
- **3D Scatter Needles:** This 3D graphic allows you to display a variable magnitude depending on the radius of a sphere. Each sphere is positioned in the 3D graph where each needle was implanted in the brain.
- **3D Scatter Needles Colored:** This 3D graphic allows you to display a variable magnitude depending on the color legend displayed with the graph. Each sphere is positioned in the 3D graph where each needle was implanted in the brain.

When the graph is selected, the next step is to select the categorical variable, except in the last to graphs where the categorical variable needles is predefined. There are 7 different categorical variables:

- **State:** State of the patient in the moment of the extraction of the data.
- **Dist_Cat:** Categorical distance classified in 5 groups.
- **Zone:** Zone in which each channel is during the extraction of the data.
- **Needles:** Needles grouped by letter, without taking into the account the channel.
- **SOZ:** If the electrode is in the SOZ or not. (1 if yes, 0 if no)
- **Pathologic HFO:** If the event is pathologic or not. (1 if yes, 0 if no)
- **State/Activity:** Relates the state of the patient with his activity.

Finally when you have all this parameters selected, you just need to select which variables would like to visualize in the graphic. There are 12 variables: **Dur f, Dur t, Area, Entropy, Perimeter, Symmetry T, Symmetry F, Oscillations, Kurtosis, Skewness, Amplitude and Inst Freq**. 
In both of the 3D Scatter Needles and 3D Scatter Needles Colored, you can also decide wether to display a 3D brain mesh of the patient or no. If the brain mesh is displayed, you can change the opacity of it, to adjust it so the data can be visualized correctly.
