This web page is the result from a Bachelor Thesis realized during the last year of the Industrial Engineering Bachelor cursed in ETSEIB, UPC. This is an interactive web, where anyone that is interested in the epilepsy area can visualize some data from various patients (all the data being displayed here is treated as totally anonimous, as no personal information is displayed to protect the intimacy of the patients) that are affected by this disease. Not only the graphic displayed in this web is interactive, meaning that you can move, zoom in and zoom out in it, but you can also select which variables are displayed in it.
